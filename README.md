# IntegrationMultiThreadTester
A simple C++ Monte Carlo integration program designed to scale well on multi-threaded machines.

This simple test can be used to indicate both processor speed and multi-thread scaling.

The tester works by generating a set of random points in the interval (a,b) and testing their heights in the sin(x)/x function.
Heights are added to a running sum, to approximate the area under the curve sin(x)/x. 
The workload is split thread-wise. 
A different set of random points is used for every run and every thread.

# integrate.cpp

## USAGE: ./integrate a b point_count thread_count

Approximates the area under the curve sin(x)/x for the interval (a,b) using the specified number of points split evenly across the specified number of threads.

# speedup.sh

speedup.sh tests a fixed number of points with a variable number of threads.
Thread count starts at 1 and increases linearly to the specified max thread count.
## USAGE: ./speedup.sh max_thread_count point_count

# efficiency.sh
 
efficiency.sh tests a variable number of points with a variable number of threads.
Thread count starts at 1 and increases linearly to the specified max thread count.
Point count starts at 100,000,000 and increases linearly by 100,000,000 per iteration.
## USAGE: ./efficiency.sh max_thread_count
